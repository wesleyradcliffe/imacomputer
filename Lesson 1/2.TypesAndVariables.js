* A variable is a container for a piece of data.
* Different programming langauges have different rules for these containers and things that go in
* them
* Javascript is whats called 'Losely' or 'Weakly' Typed. This makes it easier to use
* because it wont scream at you if you mix types. That said, mixing types is bad if you dont
* know what you're doing!
