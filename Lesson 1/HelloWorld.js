//This is a line comment. Same deal. 

//An individual line is called a 'statement'. A statement usually ends with a semicolon. ;

//You can put the double dashes in front of lines of code to make the computer ignore them.
//console.log('Hello World');

//Uncomment (remove the dashes) from the line of code above. Then SAVE the file.
//Once the file is saved, go to your command line and type out
// `node HelloWorld.js`. NEXT go to variables.js
